                Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you need no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.

                It's fun to build things! Programming is rather like playing with Lego.
                But you're building things not from physical objects but from your mind! The things you build are digital, and because they're digital, they're also infinitely malleable. You can shape and reshape them any way you like.

                Programming pioneer Grace Hopper used to ship sample code on magnetic tapes to everyone who ordered a UNIVAC. More importantly, she encouraged them to make changes, add new programs, and ship them back so she could share with others.
